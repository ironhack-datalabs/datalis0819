I am Jan

I am from Berlin.
I am typing right now... But generally I sit at home and watch YouTube while I should be working on something related to one of my masters programs.
My little bit of experience is based on courses on molecular modeling and simulation and on my research internship in molecular modeling and simulation.

I want to improve my skill set in order to either change my career path or to be able to have a heads up in the field that is the one I am most likely to specialize in.
I expect to greatly improve on my coding skills, to gain basics in machine learning and to be able to write code that may possibly do something smart.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* Which industry will you seek employment in?
* What will your future role look like?
* What is your career goal?

Not yet that clear. I hope to find the possibility to work flexibly part time in the first year in order to finish my studies while getting first experiences and making first bits of money in data analytics.
